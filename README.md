# Assignment 1: Building Models
#### CMPE 258 Section 49 | Author: Kelly Nguyen
### Description
Building models using teachable machines and on device ML
### Assignment Details
1) No code models:  Build one image model, one pose model, one audio model using teachable machines to showcase in class - demo in class your innovative work. there are lot of examples to inspire from https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQY2H8rRoyvzSZZuF0qJpoJxZR1NgzcZwLinks
you can demonstrate and submit to teachable machines group for acceptance to showcase your work

3) On device models with no customization : Build an app demonstrating mediapipe ondevice model capability on android - Hint: inspire from https://codelabs.developers.google.com/mp-image-generation-basic-android#0

4) Custom model training blackbox way using transfer learning with mlkit: build an android app using automl vision app - Hint : inspire from https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/automl-vision-edge-in-mlkit#0

5) Custom classifier with keras models - build a custom flower recognizer using colab and deploy on phone - Hint : https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/recognize-flowers-with-tensorflow-on-android-beta#0

6) Custom classifier deployed on web :  build a comment classifier web app with custom training data - Hint : https://developers.google.com/learn/pathways/on-device-ml-6

7) Embedding based ml app deployed on phone : Build a product search app using embeddings and index out of box - Hint: https://developers.google.com/learn/pathways/on-device-ml-3
